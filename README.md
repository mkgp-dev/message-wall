# message-wall
A simple Mini Message Board project submitted for The Odin Project course.

### Built With

- **Node.js** ~ Runtime environment for the backend.
- **Express** ~ Web framework handling routing and middleware.
- **TypeScript** ~ Strongly-typed JavaScript for safer server code.
- **EJS** ~ Templating engine for server-rendered views.
- **Tailwind CSS** ~ Utility-first styling, compiled via `@tailwindcss/cli`.
- **DaisyUI** ~ Tailwind component library for faster UI building.
- **nanoid** ~ Tiny, secure ID generator for messages.



### Remarks

This is my first time using TypeScript in a Node.js project, up until now I’ve mostly worked with plain JavaScript. I built this with TypeScript on purpose to start building my muscle memory for typed server-side code and to get more comfortable with it. In a way, this project lets me practice both: the familiar JavaScript ecosystem and the stricter, more structured world of TypeScript.
